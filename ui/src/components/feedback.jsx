      question:
        "What is a advantage of using the recursive method for dynamic programming?",
      correctAnswer:
        "A major advantage of using the recursive method for dynamic programming is its intuitive breakdown of complex problems into simpler subproblems, enhancing code clarity and reducing redundant calculations with memoization.",
      explanation:
        "is incorrect because recursive solutions can actually use more memory due to the overhead of maintaining a call stack. Each recursive call adds a layer to the stack, leading to higher memory usage compared to iterative solutions, which typically use loops and a limited number of variables for more efficient memory management",

        "Is the order of states visited important when using the iterative method?",
      correctAnswer:
        "Yes, the order of states visited is important when using the iterative method in dynamic programming. In the bottom-up approach, you must solve smaller subproblems first to ensure that their solutions are available when solving larger, dependent subproblems. ",
      explanation:
        "This is incorrect because the order is crucial; the iterative approach requires solving smaller subproblems first. Visiting states out of order can lead to solving problems before their dependencies are resolved, resulting in incorrect or inefficient solutions.",
      correct: "no",
      userAnswer:
        "No, the order of states visited is not important when using the iterative method in dynamic programming",
